Java EE is a standard - a way to build web applications.
Servlets, JPA, JAX-rs(rest services support) are parts of this Java EE.

Spring MVC uses the pattern known as front controller. 
All requests are diverted to the front controller. 

The way spring mvc works is we have 

M - Models - object models of things we develop.
C - Controller - the requests first comes here.

Model 2 MVC. 
	We also have a front controller - where all the request are directed first.
	This is known as the dispatcher servlet.
